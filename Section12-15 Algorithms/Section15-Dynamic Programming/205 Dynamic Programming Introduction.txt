Dynamic Programming is an Optimization Technique:
-->When you have something to cache, it could be optimized by Dynamic Programming

Caching: a way to store values, especially for those results of expensive function calls,
         where you can use them later on to speed up the computer program
Memoization: A specific way of Caching

Dynamic Programming = Divide&Conquer + Memoization

Check if a problem can use Dynamic Programming:
1. Can be divided into sub-problems
2. Recursive Solution
3. Are there repetitive sub-problems?
4. Memoize sub-problems
5. Demand a raise from your boss LOL :)
