Stacks:

LIFO

The pop operation visits the top element of a stack, but it permanently removes the element from a stack.
The peek operation returns the value stored at the top of a stack without removing it from the stack.

Queues:

FIFO

enqueue, add in Queue at the last --> push for Stack
dequeue, remove the first from Queue --> pop for Stack
